          <p class="thq-body-large">
            Copyright issues are emerging as a big headache for content creators. Even a small infringement could lead to severe consequences. Some of the main impacts are as below:

            <h2 class="thq-heading-2">Copyright Strikes And Bans</h2>
            <span class="steps-text14 thq-body-small">
              YouTube has a strong built-in mechanism, such as a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en&sjid=2133933789853475714-AP">content ID system</a>, to catch copyright issues on the spot. If detected, the consequences could be nasty. Have a look at what you can expect after each detection: <br>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>First strike: </strong>You will receive a warning and possibly lose some features like live streaming for a limited time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Second strike: </strong> More serious penalties, such as a temporary ban from uploading new content, can be applied.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Third Strike: </strong> Your YouTube account could be permanently banned, and all your videos may be taken down.
            </li>
          </ul> <br>
              Remember, if banned, recovering your account is nearly impossible. All the hard work that you have put in to build an organic audience base will be lost all of a sudden.

            <h2 class="thq-heading-2">Loss of Monetization</h2>
            <span class="steps-text17 thq-body-small">
              In case you already have monetization, copyright infringements can lead to loss of revenue. Either the revenue from it will go to the original copyright holder or YouTube may disable it. In the worst cases, the platform may disable <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?hl=en&sjid=2133933789853475714-AP">monetization</a> for your entire channel.

            <span class="steps-text20 thq-body-small">
              On top of the revenue loss, you may even have to pay a large sum out of your pocket. For content creators who rely on their income from platforms like YouTube, these fines can be devastating and may lead to bankruptcy in severe cases.

            <span class="steps-text23 thq-body-small">
              Frequent copyright strikes may hurt your brand reputation. Your audience may see you as someone who doesn’t respect intellectual property and may even unsubscribe. Brands and sponsors may hesitate to collaborate with you, fearing that their campaigns could be compromised by takedowns.

            <span class="steps-text23 thq-body-small">
              Sometimes, the impact of copyright infringement may be implicit. YouTube algorithms naturally take your content away from recommendations if your channel is frequently facing copyright issues. As a result of reduced visibility, your videos will get fewer views and lower engagement.
