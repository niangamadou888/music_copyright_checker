          <span class="steps-text14 thq-body-small">
            YouTube has a strong built-in mechanism, such as a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797370?hl=en&sjid=2133933789853475714-AP">content ID system</a>, to catch copyright issues on the spot. If detected, the consequences could be nasty. Have a look at what you can expect after each detection: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>First strike: </strong>You will receive a warning and possibly lose some features like live streaming for a limited time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Second strike: </strong> More serious penalties, such as a temporary ban from uploading new content, can be applied.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third Strike: </strong> Your YouTube account could be permanently banned, and all your videos may be taken down.
          </li>
        </ul> <br>
            Remember, if banned, recovering your account is nearly impossible. All the hard work that you have put in to build an organic audience base will be lost all of a sudden.

            In case you already have monetization, copyright infringements can lead to loss of revenue. Either the revenue from it will go to the original copyright holder or YouTube may disable it. In the worst cases, the platform may disable <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?hl=en&sjid=2133933789853475714-AP">monetization</a> for your entire channel.

          <span class="steps-text14 thq-body-small">
            One of the simplest methods to check whether an audio track is safe or not is to post it. Yes, that’s right! You can upload your video with the song as a private or unlisted video. As soon as the uploading is completed, YouTube will run its automated Content ID checks against its database of copyrighted tracks. Within seconds, you will get notified of any copyright claims through YouTube Studio. 
<br><br>
            The entire process happens quickly but does not guarantee the safety of your video because not all songs are registered in YouTube’s Content ID database. Copyright owners, who have not submitted it for ID verification, can still claim the rights later.

            The simplest step you can take when using external music is to check the descriptions and details of the video. Many artists include copyright information in the descriptions of their music videos on YouTube. Some may include it either at the beginning or end of the video with a ‘©’ symbol. However, such prior notices may not always be present.

          Using copyrighted music can cause major headaches for content creators, especially on platforms like YouTube. But don't worry—there are plenty of great alternatives to copyright-protected music that allow you to add music to your videos without risking strikes or penalties. Here are the best options to consider:

There are many websites where you can find a wide variety of royalty-free tracks. Some of the prominent ones are Free Music Archiver, Epidemic Sound, Artlist, and ccMixter.

            It is free and legal. But there’s a catch. You may need to give attribution. Luckily, some even allow free use with no strings attached. Make sure to check the specific license to see what’s required.

            The safest option is absolutely the creation of your own music. Consider renting a studio and creating audio tracks in bulk for videos over the next few months.

        <p class="thq-body-large">

          <h2 class="thq-heading-2">Check If A Song is Copyrighted</h2>
          <span class="steps-text14 thq-body-small">
            Before using any music– no matter how short it is – check if it is copyrighted. Never assume that a song isn’t copyrighted just because it’s popular or widely shared. First of all, review the descriptions and video to know if there’s any copyright marks. Then, check using our YouTube audio copyright checker or through the YouTube content ID system directly. It’s not that time-consuming, considering the consequences of copyright infringement.

          <h2 class="thq-heading-2"> Use Royalty-Free Music</h2>
          <span class="steps-text17 thq-body-small">
            The most practical approach to staying safe from copyright issues is the usage of royalty-free music. These tracks come with licenses that allow you to use the music without the risk of copyright claims. You have two options:
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Royalty-free music: </strong>You just need to pay a one-time fee to use the music safely in your content. YouTube gives you the option to buy a license for music from their platform.</li>
              <li><strong>Copyright-free YouTube music: </strong>As the name suggests, it refers to music tracks that are not protected by copyright law. You can use them freely as much as you want. </li>
            </ol>
            Platforms like the YouTube Audio Library offer a large selection of copyright-free and royalty-free tracks that are safe to use on the platform.

          <h2 class="thq-heading-2">Read The License Agreement Carefully</h2>
          <span class="steps-text20 thq-body-small">
            A royalty-free or Creative Commons License doesn’t mean that you can sit back and relax. Some licenses may have specific requirements, such as giving credit to the artist. Here are the key points to look at in a license agreement:
            <br><br>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Attribution requirements: </strong>Some songs may require you to give credit to the artist in the video description.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Commercial use: </strong>Ensure the license allows you to use the music for commercial purposes if you're monetizing your videos.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Modifications: </strong>Check if you're allowed to remix or modify the track in any way.
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            
            <br>
            
            For extra safety, always keep a copy of the license agreement or proof of purchase, especially if you’re using royalty-free music. This can protect you if a claim is ever made.

          <span class="steps-text23 thq-body-small">
            The fact is that most royalty-free tracks won’t allow commercial usage. You may need to purchase a license for it. Even though it is expensive, obtaining the copyright holder’s permission ensures that you are safe.

            Some websites offer easy licensing for commercial tracks, such as <a href="https://audiojungle.net/">AudioJungle</a>. They simplify the process of acquiring legal rights to popular songs.

            <h2 class="thq-heading-2">Avoid Common Copyright Pitfalls</h2>
            <span class="steps-text23 thq-body-small">
              There are several misconceptions that can lead content creators into legal trouble. Here are some things to avoid: <br>
              <br>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Do not rely on short clips: </strong>Many creators think that using just a few seconds of a song won’t trigger copyright claims. However, YouTube’s Content ID system is highly advanced and can detect even short snippets of copyrighted music.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Don’t assume ‘fair use’ applies: </strong>Fair use is a legal defense that only applies in specific cases, such as commentary, criticism, or parody. Just because you’re using a song for educational purposes doesn’t mean you’re protected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Be cautious with remixes and covers: </strong>Even if you’re adding your own creativity to a song for a remix, it’s still based on copyrighted material. You may need to obtain permission from the original artist.
                </li>
              </ol>
