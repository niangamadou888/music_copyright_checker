        <p class="thq-body-large">
          Copyright checks can be frustrating and time-consuming for creators. Manually searching for potential copyright risks by cross-referencing large music databases can slow down the creative process. Even one wrong step could lead to severe consequences like strikes, demonetization, account suspension, etc.. That’s why we created our YouTube music copyright checker—to make the process simple and quick.
